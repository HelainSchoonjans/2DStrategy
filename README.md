# 2D strategy game

A game based on this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-a-2d-strategy-game-in-unity).

## Skipped steps
- creating trees
- the highlighting is not working as expected. To investigate.

## Troubleshooting
- by adding a box collider I could make my clicks on the characters detected. I also had to center the box collider on the characters; there was an offset.
- the Obstacle layer had to be created and the character layer was set to obstacle.
